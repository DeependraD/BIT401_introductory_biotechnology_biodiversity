\begin{block}{The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s classical interpretation}
Agricultural biotechnology is a collection of scientific techniques, including genetic engineering, that are used to create, improve, or modify plants, animals, and microorganisms...
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the in-house research agency of
  USDA, classifies biotechnology research into six components:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    basic engineering of recombinant DNA;
  \item
    DNA sequencing;
  \item
    genomic mapping with molecular markers;
  \item
    monoclonal antibodies;
  \item
    cell fusion and chromosome transfer;
  \item
    biologically-based processing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the past, selective breeding has been practiced mostly by trial and
  error.
\item
  \alert{Genetics} is quickly transforming into a highly advanced
  scientic practice, wherein there is now not much place for trial and
  error studies.
\item
  The modern biotechnology of interest centers upon the newfound ability
  to remove DNA from cells of an organism, modify it, and reinsert it
  into cells where it will be functional.
\item
  This process is sometimes called ``genetic engineering,'' and products
  therefrom have often been ingenuously termed ``genetically modified
  organisms'' (GMOs), even though all crop plants are genetically
  modified in one way or another.
\item
  The traditional breeder's available gene pool is predominantly limited
  to those genes in sexually-compatible organisms, whereas modern
  biotechnology enables some new, wider-ranging, choices.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical plant breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{classical-plant-breeding}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Practicing classical plant breeding means many thousands of plants
  must be cross-pollinated to find the one offspring with higher yield.
\item
  Crossing plants amounts to,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Controlled pollination
  \item
    The possibility of finding improved traits is limited by the amount
    of genetic diversity already present in the plants.
  \item
    If the two plants that are crossed share many of the same genes, the
    amount of possible improvement is limited.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mutation breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{mutation-breeding}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the 1920s, scientists realized that \emph{mutations} could be
  induced in seeds by using chemical mutagens or by exposure to X-rays
  or gamma rays.
\item
  Outcome of such treatments is even less predictable than traditional
  breeding methods.
\item
  Successful in world of flowers; new colors and more petals have been
  expressed in flowers such as tulips, snapdragons, roses,
  chrysanthemums, and many others.
\item
  Mutation breeding has also been tried on vegetables, fruits, and
  crops. For instance, peppermint plants that are resistant to fungus
  were generated this way.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modern breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{modern-breeding}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduction of molecular breeding-- more predictable way to enhance
  crops.
\item
  Movement of genes from foreign sources into a specific plant,
  resulting in a \emph{transgenic} plant.
\item
  The foreign gene, or transgene, may confer specific resistance to an
  insect, protect the plant against a specific herbicide, or enhance the
  vitamin content of the crop.
\item
  With something so powerful as genetic engineering, one mistake could
  have profound and wide-ranging effects. We must impose tough controls
  on the genetics supply industry and work to make sure that the new
  techniques are in the service of the global community
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transgenic technology vs traditional breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{transgenic-technology-vs-traditional-breeding}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A plant can be transformed with a gene from any source, including
  animals, bacteria, or viruses as well as other plants, whereas
  traditional cross-breeding methods move genes only between members of
  a particular genus of plants.
\item
  Furthermore, transgenes can be placed in precise locations within the
  genome and have known functions that have been evaluated extensively
  before being inserted into the plant.
\item
  In traditional breeding, on the other hand, the identity of genes
  responsible for improving the crop is rarely known.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{history}{%
\section{History}\label{history}}

\begin{frame}{History: Classical biotechnology}
\protect\hypertarget{history-classical-biotechnology}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Clues to understanding fermentation emerged in the seventeenth century
  when Dutch experimentalist Anton Van Leeuwenhoek discovered
  microorganisms using his microscope.
\item
  He unraveled the chemical basis of the process of fermentation using
  analytical techniques for the estimation of carbon dioxide.
\item
  Two centuries later, in 1857, a French scientist Louis Pasteur
  published his first report on lactic acid formation from sugar by
  fermentation. He proved that fermentation is the consequence of
  anaerobic life and identified three of its types -- gas, alcohol and
  acid.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At the end of the nineteenth century, Eduard Buchner observed the
  formation of ethanol and carbon dioxide when cell-free extract of
  yeast was added to an aqueous solution of sugars. Thus, he proved that
  cells are not essential for the fermentation process and the
  components responsible for the process are dissolved in the extract.
  He named that substance ``Zymase''.
\item
  During World war I,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Germany produced glycerine for making the explosive nitroglycerine
  \item
    Bacteria that converts corn or molasses into acetone for making the
    explosive cordite.
  \item
    Sir Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, the first
    antibiotic, proved highly successful in treating wounded soldiers.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History: Modern genetics}
\protect\hypertarget{history-modern-genetics}{}
\scriptsize

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Francis Crick and James Watson along with Rosalind Franklin, in 1953,
  discovered that the DNA structure was a double helix: two strands
  twisted around each other like a spiral staircase with bars across
  like rings.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Structure and composition of DNA is virtually identical in all life
    forms, only difference being the order of chemical base that make up
    DNA
  \item
    Concept of changing this order was revolutionizing
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Marshall Nirenberg and H. Gobind Khorana carried out the deciphering
  of the genetic code in 1961
\item
  Walter Gilbert carried out the first DNA sequencing experiments in
  1973 (of the \textit{lac} Operator)
\item
  Term hybridomas was first coined in 1975, and production of monoclonal
  antibodies for diagnostics was carried out in 1982.
\item
  The first recombinant human therapeutic protein, insulin (humulin),
  was produced in 1982.
\item
  Genentech becomes the first biotech company to launch its own
  biopharmaceutical, human insulin produced from an \emph{E. coli}
  culture that was transformed with the functional human gene.
\item
  1980 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court allowed genetically-engineered
  microorganisms to be patented (lifeforms can theoretically become the
  private property).

  DNA was cut with restriction enzymes to generate fragments because PCR
  had not yet been invented.
\item
  Nowadays, DNA is prepared by PCR, and fluorescent dyes are used for

  purposes.

  Initially, restriction enzymes are used to generate the variation in
  DNA fragment size between individuals. Variations in the DNA base
  sequence of restriction enzyme recognition sites result in differences
  in the size of the fragments.
\item
  Such sequence differences are called restriction fragment length
  polymorphisms (\textbf{RFLPs}).
\item
  Many different restriction enzymes with distinct recognition sites are
  used on each DNA sample.
\item
  Even if mutations have changed a few bases of the target sequence
  around the cut site, there is usually still enough similarity for
  probes to bind.

  The best-known example is alcoholic fermentation (established by J. L.
  Gay-Lussac in 1815), in which sugar is converted into alcohol and
  carbon dioxide, described by the equation below.
\end{itemize}

\item
  Before 1800 the association of yeast or leaven with fermentation had
  been noted, but the nature of these agents was not understood.
\item
  Experiments of C. Cagniard-Latour, of F. T. Kutzing, and of T Schwann
  in 1837 indicated that yeast is a living organism and is the cause of
  fermentation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The biological concept became generally accepted following the work of
  Louis Pasteur, who concluded that fermentation is a physiological
  counterpart of oxidation, and permits organisms to live and grow in
  the absence of air (anaerobically).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fermentation technology: Process}
\protect\hypertarget{fermentation-technology-process}{}
During fermentation organic matter is decomposed
\alert{in the absence of air} (oxygen); hence, there is always an
accumulation of reduction products, or incomplete oxidation products.
Some of these products (for example, alcohol and lactic acid) are of
importance to society, and fermentation has therefore been used for
their manufacture on an industrial scale. With regard to historic roots
of the process, Converting dry grains and other seeds into something
more appetizing than a gruel must have made agriculture more attractive
and valuable. Alcohol, despite its dangers, provided (and still
provides), in reasonable moderation, a basis for social interaction.
There are also many microbiological processes that go on in the presence
of air while yielding incomplete oxidation products. Good examples are
the formation of acetic acid (vinegar) from alcohol by vinegar bacteria,
and of citric acid from sugar by certain molds (for example,
\emph{Aspergillus niger}). These microbial processes, too, have gained
industrial importance, and are often referred to as fermentations, even
though they do not conform to Pasteur's concept of fermentation as a
decomposition in the absence of air.
