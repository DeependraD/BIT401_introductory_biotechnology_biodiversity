The extinction of species, each one a pilgrim of four billion years of evolution, is an irreversible loss. The ending of the lines of so many creatures with whom we have traveled this far is an occasion of profound sorrow and grief. Death can be accepted and to some degree transformed. But the loss of lineages and all their future young is not something to accept. It must be rigorously and intelligently resisted.

Biodiversity is an attribute of an area and specifically refers to the
variety within and among living organisms, assemblages of living
organisms, biotic communities, and biotic processes, whether naturally
occurring or modified by humans. Biodiversity can be measured in terms
of genetic diversity and the identity and number of different types of
species, assemblages of species, biotic communities, and biotic
processes, and the amount (e.g., abundance, biomass, cover, rate) and
structure of each. It can be observed and measured at any spatial scale
ranging from microsites and habitat patches to the entire biosphere.

\item
  Biodiversity can be increased by natural evolutionary processes and
  genetic change or reduced by threats which lead to population decline
  and species extinction.
\item
  Ecosystem diversity refers to the diversity of habitats, ecosystems,
  and the accompanying ecological processes that maintain them.
\item
  The capacity of an ecosystem to respond to changes and threats
  determines the rate of biodiversity loss.
\item
  Biodiversity tends to cluster in hotspots.
\item
  Endemism is the state of a species or other taxon being restricted to
  a given area, such as a specific habitat, region, or continent.
\item
  Current species inhabitation of earth is estimated at 10-14 million.
\item
  Mass composition of biosphere is estimated at 4 Trillion mt of Carbon.
\item
  The term `biodiversity' emerged in the 1980s as a result of the
  changing understanding of the role of diversity in natural processes.

{\footnotesize When a strongly channeled outflow cools down to $40^\circ$ or below, the diversity goes up rapidly. Metazoan animals can adapt to live directly in the warm water, and eukaryotic algae such as green algae and diatoms invade. Although cyanobacteria are still abundant, they are heavily grazed, and do not form a thick mat. In different expressions of this community are found crustacea, midges (Diptera), and water mites (Hydrachnellae), dominated by a top predator, the larva of the dragonfly, \textit{Erythemis collocatta}. The net effect on diversity is to increase the species numbers to 50 to 60, exclusive of the nonphotosynthetic microorganisms.}

\item
  Concepts introduced by R. H. Whittaker
\item
  Alpha diversity (\(\alpha\)-diversity) is the mean species diversity
  in a site at a local scale.
\item
  To quantify the diversity components, species proportional abundances
  need to be taken into account. The proportional abundance of species
  \(i\) that is conditional on the limits of subunit \(j\) is
  \(p_{i|j} = \frac{m_{ij}}{m_j}\), where \(m_{ij}\) is the number of
  individuals belonging to species \(i\) in subunit \(j\) and \(m_j\) is
  the total number of individuals in subunit \(j\). The weighted
  generalized mean of all these within-subunit proportional abundance is
\end{itemize}

\[
{}^q\overline{P}_{i|j} = \sqrt[q-1]{\sum^N_{j=1} \sum^R_{i=1} p_{ij} p^{q-1}_{i|j}}
\]

Here N is the number of subunits. The proportion of data that
individuals of species \(i\) in subunit \(j\) contribute to the entire
dataset is \(p_{ij}\) and this is used as the nominal weight when
calculating mean within-subunit proportional abundance.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-10}{}
\footnotesize

The same mean \(p_{i|j}\) can also be expressed as:

\[
{}^q \overline{P}_{i|j} = \sqrt[q-1]{\sum^N_{j=1}w_j \sum^R_{i=1} p_{i|j} p^{q-1}_{i|j}}
\]

Here the subunit weight \(w_j = \frac{m_j}{m}\) equals the proportion of
the individuals in the entire dataset contributed by subunit \(j\).
Alpha diversity is obtained as an inverse of this mean:

\[
{}^q D_{\alpha} = \frac{1}{{}^q\overline{P}_{i|j}}
\]

This can also be expressed as:

\[
^q {D}_{\alpha} = \sqrt[q-1]{\sum^N_{j=1}w_j (^q {D}_{\alpha j})^{1-q}}
\]

This formula expresses the weighted generalized mean with exponent
\(1 - q\) of the mean effective species densities \(^q {D}_{\alpha j}\)
in all subunits \(j\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Alpha diversity can be calculated in both extinct and extant
  landscapes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.32\linewidth]{../images/partitioning_of_species_diversity} \caption{The calculation of species richness and species diversity in a small dataset consisting of a single tree plot. Species richness is the number of boxes (the set at left) neeeded to place all individuals into a box with an appropriate species name. Species diversity is the number of new boxes needed (the sets at right) to place all individuals into a box such that each box receives as many individuals (or as large a proportion of all individuals as the named species have, on average (only a part of the last new box may be needed). The measure of 'average' here is the weighted generalized mean with exponent $q-1$. This can be calculated by first taking the weighted mean of the absolute species abundances(6, 7.7 and 9.1 individuals for q=0,1, and 2, respectively) and then dividing this by total abundance (18 individuals). Equally well, one can calculate the weighted mean of the proportional abundances, directly (as shown in the equation of the generlized mean; R is the number of actual named species and $p_i$ is the proportional abundance of the $i$th species). Species diversity ${}^q D$ equals the inverse of mean $p_i$, and it is the effective number of species (the number of equally abundant species that would give the observed mean species abundance). The measurement unit is hence actual species (sp) in the case of richness and effective species ($sp_E$) in the case of diversity.

\begin{frame}{\(\beta\) diversity}
\protect\hypertarget{beta-diversity}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Beta(\(\beta\)) diversity is the ratio between regional and local
  species diversity. The idea was that the total species diversity in a
  landscape (\(\gamma\)) is determined by two different things, the mean
  species diversity at the local level (\(\alpha\)) and the
  differentiation among local sites (\(\beta\)). Other formulations for
  beta diversity include ``absolute species turnover'', ``Whittaker's
  species turnover'' and ``proportional species turnover''.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Whittaker \(\beta\) diversity}
\protect\hypertarget{whittaker-beta-diversity}{}
\footnotesize

\(\gamma\) diversity and \(\alpha\) diversity can be calculated directly
from species inventory data. The simplest of Whittaker's original
definitions of beta diversity is:

\[
\beta = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}
\]

Here \(\gamma\) diversity is the total species diversity of a landscape
and \(\alpha\) diversity is the mean species diversity per site. Because
the limits among local sites and landscapes are diffuse and to some
degree subjective, it has been proposed that \(\gamma\) diversity can be
quantified for any inventory dataset and that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)
diversity can be quantified whenever the dataset is divided into
subunits. \(\beta\) diversity quantifies how many subunits there would
be if the total species diversity of the dataset and the mean species
diversity per subunit remained the same, but the subunits shared no
species.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\(\gamma\) diversity}
\protect\hypertarget{gamma-diversity}{}
\footnotesize

\(\gamma\) diversity is the total species diversity in a landscape.
According to Whittaker, \(\alpha\) diversity and \(\beta\) diversity
constitute independent components of gamma diversity:

\[
\gamma = \alpha + \beta
\] Suppose species diversity is equated with the effective number of
species in a dataset. Then gamma diversity can be calculated by first
taking the weighted mean of species proportional abundances in the
dataset, and then taking the inverse of this mean. The equation is:

\[
{}^{q}\!D_{\gamma }={1 \over {\sqrt[{q-1}]{\sum _{i=1}^{S}p_{i}p_{i}^{q-1}}}}
\] The denominator equals mean proportional species abundance in the
dataset as calculated with the weighted generalized mean with exponent
\(q - 1\). In the equation, S is the total number of species (species
richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the \(i\)th
species is \(p_{i}\).

Large values of \(q\) lead to smaller gamma diversity than small values
of \(q\), because increasing \(q\) increases the weight given to those
species with the highest proportional abundance, and fewer equally
abundant species are hence needed to obtain this proportional abundance.

  Species within a guild occupy the same/similar or different ecological
  niches.
\item
  Guilds are defined according to the locations, attributes, or
  activities of their component species. For example, the mode of
  acquiring nutrients, the mobility, and the habitat zones that the
  species occupy or exploit can be used to define a guild.
\item
  Members of a guild within a given ecosystem could be competing for
  resources, such as space or light, while cooperating in resisting wind
  stresses, attracting pollinators, or detecting predators, such as
  happens among savannah-dwelling antelope and zebra.

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  \alert{Why did agriculture originate where it did ?}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Domestication in different centers of origin took place roughly some
  10,000 years ago.
\item
  Hunting-gathering to agriculture transition was not an event, but a
  long process.
\item
  Because domestication syndrome is well defined, it might have taken
  lesser time to domesticate (decades/few centuries).
\item
  With few exceptions (North America and Central Asia), most
  domestication centers are located in subtropical or tropical regions
  within \(30^\circ\) latitude.
\item
  Centers of domestication are located disproportionately frequently in
  biodiversity hotspots.
\item
  Why other regions with similar geographic and eco-climatic
  characteristics did not become centers of domestication?

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some cultures were only known to manipulate vegetation without
    actually turning to full-fledged agriculture

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  The number and location of domestication of a crop also defines
  overall genetic diversity.
\item
  A crop may have a single or multiple domestications.
\item
  Traditionally, the origin of domestication of a crop has been
  determined based on the geographic distribution of the wild ancestor,
  complemented when possible with archaeological remains. Evidence from:

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \tightlist
  \item
    earlier: floation technique

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Genetic studies have focused on individual crop and animal species.
  Yet, the sum of just these components do not define agriculture to
  full extent.
\item
  Agriculture includes agronomic and nutritional complementary systems

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \tightlist
  \item
    Most center of domestication include a combination of protein
    (legume) and starch (cereal/root) staple
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Compared to hunting and gathering, agriculture maximized the chances
  of obtaining food per unit land. That led to development of
  agriculturally based societies.
\item
  With expansion of agriculture, its ecological footprint increased,
  thus the need for sustainable agriculture that maintains its resource
  basis.
\item
  In turn, agriculture could potentially start exerting selection
  pressures that affect human phenotypes -- resistance to malaria,
  starch consumption, and lactose intolerance
\end{itemize}

\item
  \alert{How did agricultural ecosystems spread from the centers of origin?}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Two, non-mutually exclusive, modes of dispersal have been proposed to
  account for the spread of agriculture.

  \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
  \tightlist
  \item
    Culturally dispersion through adoption by non-migrating populations.
  \item
    Migration of population from center of domestication

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Biodiversity is sum total of biological diversity at various levels of
  organization -- infraspecific, species, habitats, landscape.
\item
  Replacing native biomes by agricultural vegetation is one of the major
  factors in the loss of overall biodiversity.
\item
  Amidst increased demand for agricultural products (food, feed, fiber,
  or fuel), some of the responses that are suggested to maintain
  agrobiodiversity include:

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \tightlist
  \item
    creation of biosphere reserves,
  \item
    converting agricultural production systems to more benign
    (shade-grown coffee, hedgerows),
  \item
    productivity increases to allow set-aside programs of marginal lands

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the
  maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of
  sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population,
  species, and ecosystem diversity.
\item
  Protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive
  rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions
\item
  The term and the field originated with the convening of ``The First
  International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology'' held at
  UCSD.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    concern over tropical deforestation, disappearing species, eroding
    genetic diversity within species
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Sustainable resource allocation}
\protect\hypertarget{sustainable-resource-allocation}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50\% of all
  species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years -- the
  ecological footprint of society has exceeded the bio-regenerative
  capacity limits of the planet's ecosystems by about 30 percent!
\item
  This method of measuring the global economic benefit of nature has
  been endorsed by the G8+5 leaders and the European Commission.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Many of the Earth's ecosystem services are public goods without a
    market and therefore no price or value.
  \item
    There is no natural stock market with investment portfolios (we need
    it!) into sea horses, amphibians, insects, and other creatures that
    provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are valuable
    to society.
