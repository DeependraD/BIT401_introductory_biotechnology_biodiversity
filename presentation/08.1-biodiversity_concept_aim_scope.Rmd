# Concept

## Biodiversity

###

\begin{quote}
The extinction of species, each one a pilgrim of four billion years of evolution, is an irreversible loss. The ending of the lines of so many creatures with whom we have traveled this far is an occasion of profound sorrow and grief. Death can be accepted and to some degree transformed. But the loss of lineages and all their future young is not something to accept. It must be rigorously and intelligently resisted.
\end{quote}
\begin{flushright} --Gary Snyder (1990) \end{flushright}

### Meaning

- \alert{Diversity} refers to the range of variation or variety or differences among some set of attributes
- \alert{Biological diversity} Refers to all the living things on Earth and the ecological processes associated with them. 
- Mixture of \alert{Biology} and \alert{Diversity}
- Walter G. Rosen coined the term 'Biodiversity'.
- Described in hierarchical terms including ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity.

###

Biodiversity is an attribute of an area and specifically refers to the variety within and among living organisms, assemblages of living organisms, biotic communities, and biotic processes, whether naturally occurring or modified by humans. Biodiversity can be measured in terms of genetic diversity and the identity and number of different types of species, assemblages of species, biotic communities, and biotic processes, and the amount (e.g., abundance, biomass, cover, rate) and structure of each. It can be observed and measured at any spatial scale ranging from microsites and habitat patches to the entire biosphere.

###

- Biodiversity can be increased by natural evolutionary processes and genetic change or reduced by threats which lead to population decline and species extinction.
- Ecosystem diversity refers to the diversity of habitats, ecosystems, and the accompanying ecological processes that maintain them.
- The capacity of an ecosystem to respond to changes and threats determines the rate of biodiversity loss.
- Biodiversity tends to cluster in hotspots.
- Endemism is the state of a species or other taxon being restricted to a given area, such as a specific habitat, region, or continent.
- Current species inhabitation of earth is estimated at 10-14 million.
- Mass composition of biosphere is estimated at 4 Trillion mt of Carbon.
- The term 'biodiversity' emerged in the 1980s as a result of the changing understanding of the role of diversity in natural processes.

{\footnotesize When a strongly channeled outflow cools down to $40^\circ$ or below, the diversity goes up rapidly. Metazoan animals can adapt to live directly in the warm water, and eukaryotic algae such as green algae and diatoms invade. Although cyanobacteria are still abundant, they are heavily grazed, and do not form a thick mat. In different expressions of this community are found crustacea, midges (Diptera), and water mites (Hydrachnellae), dominated by a top predator, the larva of the dragonfly, \textit{Erythemis collocatta}. The net effect on diversity is to increase the species numbers to 50 to 60, exclusive of the nonphotosynthetic microorganisms.}

  \item In deserts, 500-1000 /$m^2$, they run deeper upto 10m where they follow plant roots
  \item Eat decaying organic matter (and the microorganisms contained), consume fungi, algae, nematodes, bacteria, etc.
  \item Oribatid mites in soil facilitate plant growth by dispersing the spores of mycorrhizal fungi, which form mutualistic associations with former.
  \item Many plants produce domatia -- hollow, mite sized cavities or pockets in the leaf. Experiments have shown that removal of domatia from some plants that normally have them reduces the density of beneficial predatory mites and increases the density of herbivorous mites.

### Definition

\begin{block}{Diversity}
\footnotesize
The existence of a wide variety of species (species diversity), other taxa of plants or other organisms in a natural environment or habitat, or communities within a particular environment (ecological diversity), or of genetic variation within a species (genetic diversity).
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Biodiversity defined under CBD Article 2(1)}
\footnotesize
the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Agrobiodiversity}
\footnotesize
The variety and variability of animals, plants, and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture (crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries). it comprises the diversity of genetic resources (varieties, breeds, etc.) and species used for food, fuel, fodder, fiber, and pharmaceuticals.

```

### Distribution

- Generally, diversity is more in warmer and wetter climates than in cooler and drier ones (McNeely et al., 1990). Seventy per cent of the world’s biodiversity is found in only 12 "mega-diverse" countries -- Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Zaire, Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Mexico – which, with the exception of Australia, are all developing, non-Western nations.

- South africa contains the most biological diversity in plant species. [Wilson, 1992, p. 260]

- Mainly conditioned by
  - temperature,
  - precipitation,
  - altitude,
  - soils,
  - geography and
  - presence of other species

## Importance

### General values

- Species have utilitarian (subsistence and commercial) value to human,
- Biodiversity represents the natural balance within an ecosystem that provides a number of ecological services, including nutrient cycling and pollination of plants, and
- Species have intrinsic value; value of life
- Linked to daily livelihood and economic wellbeing of Nepalese
- Specifically,
  - Genetic diversity provides resources for genetic resistance to pests and diseases;
  - In agriculture, biodiversity is a production system characterized by the presence of multiple plant and/or animal species

```


### Ecosystem services: beneficial consequences of biodiversity

- Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water). Greater species diversity
  - increases fodder yield
  - increases overall crop yield
  - increases overall wood production, in trees
- Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control). Greater species diversity
  - of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield
  - of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations
  - of plants decreases disease prevalence on plants
  - of plants increases resistance to plant invasion
  - of plants increases carbon sequestration, but note that this finding only relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long term storage
  - plants increases soil nutrient remineralization

### Nonmaterial services

\footnotesize

- Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance
- Betterment of knowledge systems
- Educational value

### Genetic diversity

### $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ diversities

\footnotesize

- Concepts introduced by R. H. Whittaker
- Alpha diversity ($\alpha$-diversity) is the mean species diversity in a site at a local scale.
- To quantify the diversity components, species proportional abundances need to be taken into account. The proportional abundance of species $i$ that is conditional on the limits of subunit $j$ is $p_{i|j} = \frac{m_{ij}}{m_j}$, where $m_{ij}$ is the number of individuals belonging to species $i$ in subunit $j$ and $m_j$ is the total number of individuals in subunit $j$. The weighted generalized mean of all these within-subunit proportional abundance is

$$
{}^q\overline{P}_{i|j} = \sqrt[q-1]{\sum^N_{j=1} \sum^R_{i=1} p_{ij} p^{q-1}_{i|j}}
$$

Here N is the number of subunits. The proportion of data that individuals of species $i$ in subunit $j$ contribute to the entire dataset is $p_{ij}$ and this is used as the nominal weight when calculating mean within-subunit proportional abundance.

###

\footnotesize

The same mean $p_{i|j}$ can also be expressed as:

$$
{}^q \overline{P}_{i|j} = \sqrt[q-1]{\sum^N_{j=1}w_j \sum^R_{i=1} p_{i|j} p^{q-1}_{i|j}}
$$

Here the subunit weight $w_j = \frac{m_j}{m}$ equals the proportion of the individuals in the entire dataset contributed by subunit $j$. Alpha diversity is obtained as an inverse of this mean:

$$
{}^q D_{\alpha} = \frac{1}{{}^q\overline{P}_{i|j}}
$$

This can also be expressed as:

$$
^q {D}_{\alpha} = \sqrt[q-1]{\sum^N_{j=1}w_j (^q {D}_{\alpha j})^{1-q}}
$$

This formula expresses the weighted generalized mean with exponent $1 - q$ of the mean effective species densities $^q {D}_{\alpha j}$ in all subunits $j$.

- Alpha diversity can be calculated in both extinct and extant landscapes.

```{r relation-alpha-beta-gamma, fig.cap="The calculation of species richness and species diversity in a small dataset consisting of a single tree plot. Species richness is the number of boxes (the set at left) neeeded to place all individuals into a box with an appropriate species name. Species diversity is the number of new boxes needed (the sets at right) to place all individuals into a box such that each box receives as many individuals (or as large a proportion of all individuals as the named species have, on average (only a part of the last new box may be needed). The measure of 'average' here is the weighted generalized mean with exponent $q-1$. This can be calculated by first taking the weighted mean of the absolute species abundances(6, 7.7 and 9.1 individuals for q=0,1, and 2, respectively) and then dividing this by total abundance (18 individuals). Equally well, one can calculate the weighted mean of the proportional abundances, directly (as shown in the equation of the generlized mean; R is the number of actual named species and $p_i$ is the proportional abundance of the $i$th species). Species diversity ${}^q D$ equals the inverse of mean $p_i$, and it is the effective number of species (the number of equally abundant species that would give the observed mean species abundance). The measurement unit is hence actual species (sp) in the case of richness and effective species ($sp_E$) in the case of diversity. Reproduced from [@tuomisto2011commentary].", out.width="32%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../images/partitioning_of_species_diversity.png")
```


### $\beta$ diversity

- Beta($\beta$) diversity is the ratio between regional and local species diversity. The idea was that the total species diversity in a landscape ($\gamma$) is determined by two different things, the mean species diversity at the local level ($\alpha$) and the differentiation among local sites ($\beta$). Other formulations for beta diversity include "absolute species turnover", "Whittaker's species turnover" and "proportional species turnover".

### Whittaker $\beta$ diversity

\footnotesize

$\gamma$ diversity and $\alpha$ diversity can be calculated directly from species inventory data. The simplest of Whittaker's original definitions of beta diversity is:

$$
\beta = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}
$$

Here $\gamma$ diversity is the total species diversity of a landscape and $\alpha$ diversity is the mean species diversity per site. Because the limits among local sites and landscapes are diffuse and to some degree subjective, it has been proposed that $\gamma$ diversity can be quantified for any inventory dataset and that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity can be quantified whenever the dataset is divided into subunits. $\beta$ diversity quantifies how many subunits there would be if the total species diversity of the dataset and the mean species diversity per subunit remained the same, but the subunits shared no species.

### $\gamma$ diversity

\footnotesize

$\gamma$ diversity is the total species diversity in a landscape. According to Whittaker, $\alpha$ diversity and $\beta$ diversity constitute independent components of gamma diversity:

$$
\gamma = \alpha + \beta
$$
Suppose species diversity is equated with the effective number of species in a dataset. Then gamma diversity can be calculated by first taking the weighted mean of species proportional abundances in the dataset, and then taking the inverse of this mean. The equation is:

$$
{}^{q}\!D_{\gamma }={1 \over {\sqrt[{q-1}]{\sum _{i=1}^{S}p_{i}p_{i}^{q-1}}}}
$$
The denominator equals mean proportional species abundance in the dataset as calculated with the weighted generalized mean with exponent $q - 1$. In the equation, S is the total number of species (species richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the $i$th species is $p_{i}$.

Large values of $q$ lead to smaller gamma diversity than small values of $q$, because increasing $q$ increases the weight given to those species with the highest proportional abundance, and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to obtain this proportional abundance.

### Guild^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_(ecology)]

- A guild (or ecological guild) is any group of species that exploit the same resources, or that exploit different resources in related ways.
- Species within a guild occupy the same/similar or different ecological niches.
- Guilds are defined according to the locations, attributes, or activities of their component species. For example, the mode of acquiring nutrients, the mobility, and the habitat zones that the species occupy or exploit can be used to define a guild.
- Members of a guild within a given ecosystem could be competing for resources, such as space or light, while cooperating in resisting wind stresses, attracting pollinators, or detecting predators, such as happens among savannah-dwelling antelope and zebra.

# Aim

### Identification and characterization

### Conservation biology

- Conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity.
- Protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions
- The term and the field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at UCSD.
  - concern over tropical deforestation, disappearing species, eroding genetic diversity within species
- Closely related to ecology in researching the population ecology (dispersal, migration, demographics, effective population size, inbreeding depression, and minimum population viability) of rare or endangered species.

###

::: incremental

5. \alert{How can biodiversity be maintained or enhanced in agroecosystems?}
- Biodiversity is sum total of biological diversity at various levels of organization -- infraspecific, species, habitats, landscape.
- Replacing native biomes by agricultural vegetation is one of the major factors in the loss of overall biodiversity.
- Amidst increased demand for agricultural products (food, feed, fiber, or fuel), some of the responses that are suggested to maintain agrobiodiversity include:
  - creation of biosphere reserves,
  - converting agricultural production systems to more benign (shade-grown coffee, hedgerows),
  - productivity increases to allow set-aside programs of marginal lands
:::

### Sustainable resource allocation

- The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years -- the ecological footprint of society has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planet's ecosystems by about 30 percent!
- This method of measuring the global economic benefit of nature has been endorsed by the G8+5 leaders and the European Commission.
  - Many of the Earth's ecosystem services are public goods without a market and therefore no price or value.
  - There is no natural stock market with investment portfolios (we need it!) into sea horses, amphibians, insects, and other creatures that provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are valuable to society.
