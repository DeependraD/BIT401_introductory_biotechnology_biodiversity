# Background

### Overview

\begin{block}{The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s classical interpretation}
Agricultural biotechnology is a collection of scientific techniques, including genetic engineering, that are used to create, improve, or modify plants, animals, and microorganisms...
\end{block}

- Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the in-house research agency of USDA, classifies biotechnology research into six components: 
  - basic engineering of recombinant DNA; 
  - DNA sequencing; 
  - genomic mapping with molecular markers; 
  - monoclonal antibodies; 
  - cell fusion and chromosome transfer; 
  - biologically-based processing

###

- In the past, selective breeding has been practiced mostly by trial and error. 
- \alert{Genetics} is quickly transforming into a highly advanced scientic practice, wherein there is now not much place for trial and error studies.
- The modern biotechnology of interest centers upon the newfound ability to remove DNA from cells of an organism, modify it, and reinsert it into cells where it will be functional. 
- This process is sometimes called "genetic engineering," and products therefrom have often been ingenuously termed "genetically modified organisms" (GMOs), even though all crop plants are genetically modified in one way or another.
- The traditional breeder's available gene pool is predominantly limited to those genes in sexually-compatible organisms, whereas modern biotechnology enables some new, wider-ranging, choices.

### Classical plant breeding

- Practicing classical plant breeding means many thousands of plants must be cross-pollinated to find the one offspring with higher yield. 
- Crossing plants amounts to, 
  - Controlled pollination 
  - The possibility of finding improved traits is limited by the amount of genetic diversity already present in the plants. 
  - If the two plants that are crossed share many of the same genes, the amount of possible improvement is limited. 

### Mutation breeding

- In the 1920s, scientists realized that *mutations* could be induced in seeds by using chemical mutagens or by exposure to X-rays or gamma rays.
- Outcome of such treatments is even less predictable than traditional breeding methods. 
- Successful in world of flowers; new colors and more petals have been expressed in flowers such as tulips, snapdragons, roses, chrysanthemums, and many others.
- Mutation breeding has also been tried on vegetables, fruits, and crops. For instance, peppermint plants that are resistant to fungus were generated this way.

### Modern breeding

- Introduction of molecular breeding-- more predictable way to enhance crops. 
- Movement of genes from foreign sources into a specific plant, resulting in a *transgenic* plant. 
- The foreign gene, or transgene, may confer specific resistance to an insect, protect the plant against a specific herbicide, or enhance the vitamin content of the crop. 
- With something so powerful as genetic engineering, one mistake could have profound and wide-ranging effects. We must impose tough controls on the genetics supply industry and work to make sure that the new techniques are in the service of the global community

### Transgenic technology vs traditional breeding

- A plant can be transformed with a gene from any source, including animals, bacteria, or viruses as well as other plants, whereas traditional cross-breeding methods move genes only between members of a particular genus of plants.
- Furthermore, transgenes can be placed in precise locations within the genome and have known functions that have been evaluated extensively before being inserted into the plant. 
- In traditional breeding, on the other hand, the identity of genes responsible for improving the crop is rarely known.

# History

### History: Classical biotechnology

- Clues to understanding fermentation emerged in the seventeenth century when Dutch experimentalist Anton Van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms using his microscope. 
- He unraveled the chemical basis of the process of fermentation using analytical techniques for the estimation of carbon dioxide. 
- Two centuries later, in 1857, a French scientist Louis Pasteur published his first report on lactic acid formation from sugar by fermentation. He proved that fermentation is the consequence of anaerobic life and identified three of its types -- gas, alcohol and acid.

###

- At the end of the nineteenth century, Eduard Buchner observed the formation of ethanol and carbon dioxide when cell-free extract of yeast was added to an aqueous solution of sugars. Thus, he proved that cells are not essential for the fermentation process and the components responsible for the process are dissolved in the extract. He named that substance "Zymase". 
- During World war I, 
  - Germany produced glycerine for making the explosive nitroglycerine
  - Bacteria that converts corn or molasses into acetone for making the explosive cordite. 
  - Sir Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic, proved highly successful in treating wounded soldiers.

### History: Modern genetics

\scriptsize

- Francis Crick and James Watson along with Rosalind Franklin, in 1953, discovered that the DNA structure was a double helix: two strands twisted around each other like a spiral staircase with bars across like rings.
  - Structure and composition of DNA is virtually identical in all life forms, only difference being the order of chemical base that make up DNA
  - Concept of changing this order was revolutionizing
- Marshall Nirenberg and H. Gobind Khorana carried out the deciphering of the genetic code in 1961
- Walter Gilbert carried out the first DNA sequencing experiments in 1973 (of the \textit{lac} Operator)
- Term hybridomas was first coined in 1975, and production of monoclonal antibodies for diagnostics was carried out in 1982. 
- The first recombinant human therapeutic protein, insulin (humulin), was produced in 1982. 
- Genentech becomes the first biotech company to launch its own biopharmaceutical, human insulin produced from an _E. coli_ culture that was transformed with the functional human gene.
- 1980 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court allowed genetically-engineered microorganisms to be patented (lifeforms can theoretically become the private property).

- In previous century, industries linked to the fermentation technology had grown tremendously because of the high demand for various chemicals such as ethanol, butanol, glycerine, acetone, etc. 

#### Bioprocessing
Processes (comprising media and buffer preparation, upstream processing and downstream processing) used for large-scale production of chemicals, including proteins, enzymes and antibiotics in an economical manner. Major bioprocessing facilities today are reliant on biochemistry of fermentation.

### Bioprocessing steps

\footnotesize

- Upstream processing: development of processes for aseptic treatment of substrates or raw materials with the microorganism or the biocatalyst and optimization of chemical environment to carry out required biochemical reaction.
  - Unit operations: Milling, Mixing, Media preparation, Sterilization, Cooling, Heating.
- \alert{Bioreactor} (vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products, using microorganisms, plants, animals, or human cells or individual enzymes) or fermentor are designed in first step.
- Bioreactor supports the natural process of cells by trying to maintain their environment to provide optimum growth conditions by providing appropriate temperature, pH, substrates, salts, vitamins, and oxygen while using biotransformation substrate to convert them to desired product.
  - Unit operations: Mixing, Handling of microorganisms, plant or animal cells, Inoculation of the cells, Heating and cooling.
- Downstream processing: recovery and purification of the required product from the growth medium through a set of separation and purification techniques. 
  - Unit operations: includes techniques such as filtration, centrifugation, sedimentation, various types of chromatographic techniques, electrophoresis, etc.

# Fields of Biotechnology

## Environmental biotechnology

### Overview

- People have always been fascinated by the environment around them and successful in harnessing the environment for our benefit.
- Curiosity to explore uncharted life forms drives our motivations.
- Virosphere! How big is it?
- Human body harbors $10^{14}$ bacteria, while our own only comprise $10^{13}$.

### Applications

- An increase in the productivity of crops, without an increase in the dependency on environmentally-damaging agrochemicals.
- As a result of increased productivity, a reduced pressure to exploit the remaining uncultivated habitats.
- As a result of increased productivity, a reduction in energy inputs (mostly from reduced agrochemical manufacture).
- The creation of alternative, renewable, sources of energy (e.g., biodiesel).
- The creation of new more environment-friendly raw materials for industry (e.g., biodegradable plastics from plant starches, or high-value speciality chemicals).
- As a result of the development of genetically-modified crops (if properly used), a reduction in the amount of agrochemical (e.g., pesticides and herbicides) released into the environment.

### Bio-environmental processes

\alert{Bioremediation}

- One of the avenues in biotechnology that has made rapid advances
- "biological" means of cleaning the environment.
- Naturally occurring microorganisms often have the ability to degrade human-made pollutants. 
- _Rhodococcus_ sp. has a highly diverse pathways to degrade pollutants, such as short- and long-chain alkanes, aromatic molecules (both halogenated and nitro-substituted), and heterocyclic and polycyclic aromatic compounds, including quino lone, pyridine, thiocarbamate, s-triazine herbicides, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (a rubber vulcanization accelerator), benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene, MTBE, and the related ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE).

### Bio-environmental processes

- \alert{Biostimulation} is the release of nutrients, oxidants, or electron donors into the environment to stimulate naturally occurring microorganisms to degrade a contaminant. 
- \alert{Bioaugmentation} is adding specific microorganisms plus their energy sources to decontaminate a polluted area.
- \alert{Microbial fuel cells} create electricity through the use of microorganisms. Organisms that transfer electrons to the anode are called electrode-reducing organisms. They can pass electrons through a mediator molecule in the solution, directly through proteins in their outer membrane, or through nanowires or pili that coat the outer surface of the bacterium. Electrode-oxidizing organisms take electrons from the cathode to reduce various substances, such as carbon dioxide to acetate.

### Biofuel production

```{r biofuel-production, fig.cap="\\textbf{(A)} Production of ethanol from corn requires the addition of ammonia to adjust the pH and enzymes to help digest starch and yeast to ferment the corn mash. \\textbf{(B)} Biodiesel is created by the blending of methanol, sodium hydroxide, and vegetable oil for 20-30 minutes.", out.width="28%"}
# The ethanol is distilled to 95% purity and then purified further by passing through molecular sieves. The purified ethanol is rendered undrinkable by addition of denaturants. The remaining corn products after distillation include liquid sugars and solids that are used to feed livestock.

# The process creates biodiesel and glycerin that separate naturally because glycerin has a higher density than biodiesel.

```

### Mechanism

- PCR is routinely used to amplify random sequences from many environmental samples in the hope of identifying new genes.
- After PCR DNA is sequenced.
- Then bioinformatics reveals whether or not the sequence (or a close relative) has already been identified or if it is completely novel.
- Microarrays are used to compare numbers and types of organisms present in different environment.

### Identifying new genes with metagenomics

- Allows identification of microorganisms, viruses, or free DNA that exist in the natural environment.
- Approaches: next-generation DNA sequencing, PCR, RT-PCR and microarrays
- Metagenomics is the process of statistically combining separate genomic analyses; deals with a mixture of DNA forms.
- Study of marine microbiology, human gut microbiology, assessment of how microorganisms form symbiotic relationships with their hosts, finding novel antibiotics or enzymes, replacement of chemical pesticides with crops genetically engineered for tolerance to microorganisms and nematodes, etc.

knitr::include_graphics("../images/environmental_techniques.png")
```

## Medical biotechnology

### Applications

- Cheaper medicines from biotechnology
- Medicines from 'cultured' cells
- Genetic modification for medicine production
- Immune technology; Killed pathogens, attenuated pathogens, single proteins, or epitopes from a disease-causing pathogen are used as vaccines. They are isolated and injected into people to elicit their immune response without causing the disease. Multivalent vaccines contain antigens to different proteins from a pathogen or family of pathogens.
- Cancer technology; Oncogene detection, oncogene attenuation

### 

- Gene therapy; Engineered retroviruses are the most frequently used viral vectors in gene therapy. Defective retrovirus vectors are grown in cells with an integrated helper virus to allow formation of virus particles.
- ELISA assay; Antibodies are used in ELISA assays to determine the relative concentration of the target protein or antigen in a sample. Primary antibodies recognize the target protein or antigen. Secondary antibodies recognize the primary antibody and often carry a detection system. Secondary antibodies are made to recognize any antibody that is made in sheep, cow, rabbit, goat, or mouse.

### Stem cell therapy

- Characteristics of stem cells: 
  - they maintain the ability to divide continually, 
  - they are undifferentiated, and
  - they have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types 
- Embryonic stem cells are totipotent. 
- Adult or somatic stem cells are able to differentiate into different cell types but are multipotent; that is, they are restricted to the tissues in which they originate. 
- Embryonic stem cell lines are created from the inner cell mass of the blastula stage of an embryo from many different mammals, including humans, mice, and primates. 
- The cell lines can be induced to differentiate by forming embryoid bodies that ultimately differentiate into different cell types.

knitr::include_graphics("../images/dolly_cloning.png")
```

## Forensic biotechnology

- Researches and uses the basis of identity to resolve conflicting situations and help create unique database of individuals.
- Fingerprint patterns are multigenic trait.
- Retinal scans take advantage of the unique pattern of blood vessels on the retina at the back of the eyes.
- Blood typing provides identity based on presence of blood antigens groups.

### DNA fingerprinting

- DNA fingerprinting relies on the unique pattern made by a series of DNA fragments after separating them according to length by gel electrophoresis.
- The samples are then processed to generate a set of DNA fragments. When Alec Jeffreys invented DNA fingerprinting in 1985 in England, the DNA was cut with restriction enzymes to generate fragments because PCR had not yet been invented. 
- Nowadays, DNA is prepared by PCR, and fluorescent dyes are used for labeling. In addition, modern DNA fingerprinting uses repeated sequences (short tandem repeats or STRs) for routine identification purposes.

### RFLP fingerprinting

- Initially, restriction enzymes are used to generate the variation in DNA fragment size between individuals. Variations in the DNA base sequence of restriction enzyme recognition sites result in differences in the size of the fragments. 
- Such sequence differences are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms (**RFLPs**). 
- Many different restriction enzymes with distinct recognition sites are used on each DNA sample.
- Even if mutations have changed a few bases of the target sequence around the cut site, there is usually still enough similarity for probes to bind. 

(For a detailed discussion of RFLP fingerprinting, with an example case, refer to Chapter on Genetic Engineering and Gene Cloning.)

## Industrial biotechnology

### Natural and engineered bio-chemicals

- Recombinant microorganisms, plant cells, and animal cells can be cultivated and used for large-scale production of industrially-important enzymes and chemicals. A list of such enzymes is given in Table \ref{tab:industrial-chemicals}

```{r industrial-chemicals, echo=FALSE}
industrial_chemicals <- read_csv("./../data/industrial_enzymes_biotechnology.csv")
industrial_chemicals %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Some major industrial enzymes and their sources and uses.", 
               booktabs = TRUE, digits = 2, escape = FALSE) %>%

  kableExtra::column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1:3, width = c("8em","26em","30em"))
```

### Fermentation technology

\footnotesize

- Decomposition of foodstuffs generally accompanied by the evolution of gas. 
- The best-known example is alcoholic fermentation (established by J. L. Gay-Lussac in 1815), in which sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, described by the equation below.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&C_6 H_{12} O_6 &\rightarrow &2CO_2 + &2C_2H_5OH \\
&\textrm{Sugar} &&\textrm{Carbon dioxide} &\textrm{Alcohol}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Before 1800 the association of yeast or leaven with fermentation had been noted, but the nature of these agents was not understood. 
- Experiments of C. Cagniard-Latour, of F. T. Kutzing, and of T Schwann in 1837 indicated that yeast is a living organism and is the cause of fermentation. 

<!-- - This view was opposed by such leading chemists as J. von Liebig and F. Wohler, who sought a chemical rather than a biological explanation of the process.  -->

- The biological concept became generally accepted following the work of Louis Pasteur, who concluded that fermentation is a physiological counterpart of oxidation, and permits organisms to live and grow in the absence of air (anaerobically). 

<!-- - This linked fermentation and putrefaction as comparable processes; both represent decomposition of organic matter brought about by microorganisms in the absence of air.  -->
<!-- - The difference is determined by the nature of the decomposable material;  -->
<!--   - sugary substances generally yield products with pleasant odor and taste (fermentation),  -->
<!--   - proteins give rise to evil-smelling products (putrefaction).  -->
<!-- - Pasteur also discovered the lactic acid and butyric acid fermentations, and from his experiments concluded that each kind of fermentation was caused by a specific microbe.  -->
<!-- - Later work supported this idea to a large extent, and considerably increased the number of specific fermentations. -->

### Fermentation technology: Process

During fermentation organic matter is decomposed \alert{in the absence of air} (oxygen); hence, there is always an accumulation of reduction products, or incomplete oxidation products. Some of these products (for example, alcohol and lactic acid) are of importance to society, and fermentation has therefore been used for their manufacture on an industrial scale. With regard to historic roots of the process, Converting dry grains and other seeds into something more appetizing than a gruel must have made agriculture more attractive and valuable. Alcohol, despite its dangers, provided (and still provides), in reasonable moderation, a basis for social interaction. There are also many microbiological processes that go on in the presence of air while yielding incomplete oxidation products. Good examples are the formation of acetic acid (vinegar) from alcohol by vinegar bacteria, and of citric acid from sugar by certain molds (for example, _Aspergillus niger_). These microbial processes, too, have gained industrial importance, and are often referred to as fermentations, even though they do not conform to Pasteur’s concept of fermentation as a decomposition in the absence of air.
